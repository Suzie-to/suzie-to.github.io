    <h3>Offtopic but not quite...</h3>
    <p>I would like to present to you a mesmerizing spectacle that unfolds every winter in my country of origin - Bulgaria. 
      Men adorned in elaborate and often terrifying costumes take to the streets, unleashing a symphony of loud noises and 
      engaging in lively dances.These individuals, known as Kukeri, are the bearers of an ancient pagan tradition, striving 
      to protect their community by warding off evil spirits and ushering in good fortune and fertility.
    
      The masks worn by the Kukeri hold a significant role in this tradition. Crafted from animal fur, 
      they boast intricate designs featuring horns, fangs, and exaggerated facial expressions. These masks symbolize a 
      wide array of mythical creatures and deities, their formidable appearance intended to strike fear into malevolent forces.
      
      During the kukeri procession, an enchanting cacophony ensues. The participants stomp their feet, jingle their bells, 
      and wield wooden sticks or whips, creating a rhythmic symphony of sound. Their movements, carefully choreographed, give 
      life to lively dances that symbolize the reawakening of nature and the cycle of life itself..</p>
